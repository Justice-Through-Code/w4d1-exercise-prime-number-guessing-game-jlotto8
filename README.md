# Number Range Analysis

## W4D1 - Number Range Analysis

In this coding challenge, you will work on creating a Python program that allows users to analyze a range of numbers. 

### Estimated Time to Complete

60 minutes

---

## Challenge Overview

The program will perform various tasks related to the numbers within that range, calculating the sum, and identifying the smallest and largest numbers. 


## Getting Started

0. Accept the challenge via the GitHub Classroom link (if you're already here, you've done this part!)
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Follow the instructions in `number_range_analysis.py`.

## Unit Testing

In the `test_number_range_analysis.py` file, you will find unittests for the functions you implemented. Make sure your functions pass these tests.

3. From the main folder of the challenge, run your computer's version of `python3 -m unittest` to see if your code works as expected.

REMEMBER: Comment out or delete the calls to your functions -- the test will not run with them!

## Git Local

4. Perform commands for `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`.

## Git Remote

5. Access your GitHub Repository: Go to the GitHub website and log in to your account.
6. Navigate to the repository for this exercise.
7. Watch for the Red X (or yellow dot as the test runs) to change to the green check mark. The green check mark on a GitHub repository indicates that the commit or pull request has been tested and meets the defined criteria for correctness.
8. If there's a red "X" instead, it means the tests have failed. You'll need to investigate and fix the issues in VScode, then perform the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` steps again.

## Grade in Canvas

9. The status in Canvas does not change to Complete until an Instructor has reviewed your assignment. This process is similar to the Code review process in a real work scenario. A code review by an instructor or a senior developer after unit tests pass is an important step in the software development process. It helps ensure that the code not only functions correctly but also adheres to best practices, coding standards, and maintainability guidelines.

You are all set!
